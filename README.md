# What can we learn about POAP holders?

A little bit of intro, I love to create and collect POAPs. 3 Days ago sitting in the opening ceremony of ETHGlobal Istanbul, show casing all the past events. I thought about how cool it would be to retroactivly check all the POAP's that have gotten created over the events from ETHGlobal and Sponsors - to show and see how many people do own an ENS, what has been teir first on-chain interaction, How do they interqact with the evm chains ingeneral.

## What is POAP?
POAP is an acronym for Proof of Attendance Protocol. It is a way of creating and collecting digital souvenirs that show you were part of an event, either online or offline. POAPs are NFTs that follow a standard format and protocol, and are minted on the POAP smart contracts. Each POAP has a unique serial number and a timestamp that links it to a specific event. You can scan a QR code or an Card with NFC at the event to claim your POAP, and then trade or transfer it as you wish. POAPs are more than just mementos, they are also a way of building relationships, communities and stories around events.

Here all the POAP's that I've collected over the time. [Check it out](https://collectors.poap.xyz/scan/0xae46e37b5628947ac159f001a847e87452175d99)
